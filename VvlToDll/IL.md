# IL

I'm going insane. Behold the ramblings of a woman going progressivly deeper into n-sanity.

I've been looking into the IL bytecode for a few days now and I've learned that VV do not just use the instructions defined in ECMA-335. Here are the instructions I've noted.

| Bytes     | ECMA-335 Name                              | ECMA-335 differences                                           | Notes
